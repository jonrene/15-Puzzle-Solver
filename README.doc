This software is used as a solver for the 15-piece puzzle:
https://lorecioni.github.io/fifteen-puzzle-game/


The code for my program is located in the file named A*Search.doc


In order to run the code, simply open the file, copy all the code, and paste it in a compiler that can run code in python. I recommend Visual Studio Code or online 
compiler: https://repl.it/languages/python3. Keep in mind the later will take a bit longer to compile. 

The program will first greet the user and present the purpose of the program. 
The goal state will be displayed. 

The user will then be prompted if he or she would like to enter his or her own board. If not, one will be created. 

If the user decides to enter his or her own board, it must be done in a specific format. 
Numbers must be separated with a comma and a space. The program will inform the user if the entered board is valid. 

The program will then prompt the user to see which heuristic he or she would like to use, Manhattan Distance or number of misplaced tiles. The program will then conduct a search for the solution. 

The results will show every state of the board from the initial state to the goal state.
